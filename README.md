Notes:
No high technical background needed: just run the app, open the browser, click upload, and see results.
If you face any issue, check that Python is installed and internet is available.(for model download.I used facebook's 'bart-large-cnn' its small,fast and reliable).
You must connect your own Google Sheets account in n8n 
after importing the workflow, since credentials are not included.
